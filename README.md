The repository stores the data useful to replicate the results shown in “Ash and ice aggregation in satellite retrieval: the 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai hydromagmatic eruption”.

The 3 subfolders store:
- folder 2_cm : matrices of BTs (converted from spectral radiances using inverse of Plank's function) at different wavelenghts (downloaded via NOAA's Big Data Program)
- folder 3_mp : meteo profile nearby volcano (downloaded from ERA5)
- folder 7_sim: matrices of estimated masses
